<h2>Team Go getters</h2>

<article> <p>The goal of this project was to build the popular game show Deal or No Deal entirely in PHP for the backend logic and HTML/CSS for the frontend interface. Though PHP is a robust server-side language, we wanted to push the boundaries of what was possible for game logic using PHP alone. The frontend visuals and animations were also limited to HTML and CSS without the use of JavaScript.</p> <br> 
<p>Deal or No Deal was selected specifically because gameplay involves complex logic like randomly selecting suitcases, calculating monetary offers, and determining win conditions. Coding this in PHP provided opportunities to be creative in simulating real-time gameplay events server-side. HTML and CSS allowed crafting an authentic gameshow interface and animations to enhance user experience.</p> <br> 

<p>However, limitations in relying solely on HTML, CSS and PHP emerged. Unlike JavaScript, PHP cannot perform dynamic client-side logic after the page loads. This meant all game flow had to be predefined by the backend PHP scripts. Additionally, no fetching external data like live monetary offers was possible without JavaScript APIs.</p><br> 

 <p>Given these constraints, the team pivoted to pre-programming the various game scenarios in PHP rather than direct interactivity. The HTML/CSS frontend simulated game events triggered by user clicks which called PHP functions. To allocate work, the team used a Kanban system to divide tasks, assign owners, and adjust plans as needed.

</p> <br> 

 <p>In the end, this project provided great learning about how far PHP logic can stretch despite lacks compared to JavaScript. Creatively pre-programming various game scenarios was crucial to overcoming interactive limitations. Though ambitions were reigned in, the end product was an authentic Deal or No Deal simulation using core web technologies. Just like in our CSS chess project, constraints provided lessons in flexibility, management, and thinking innovatively within technical limits.</p>
